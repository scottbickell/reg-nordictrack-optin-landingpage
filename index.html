                To enter you must consent to receive emails from NordicTrack and iFit regarding deals, discounts,
                exercise information, and requests to review products you have purchased. If you are already receiving

                Sweepstakes. You can opt-out of receiving emails from ICON at any time and will remain entered into the

                disqualification. Sponsor is not responsible for lost, late, incomplete, invalid, unintelligible or
                misdirected entries all of which will be ineligible to win a prize. In the event of a dispute as to any
                entrant, the authorized account holder of the email address used to enter will be deemed to be the
                entrant. The “authorized account holder” is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet
                access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses
                for the domain associated with the submitted address. Potential winner may be required to show proof of
                being the authorized account holder to be awarded the prize.

                damages, injuries or losses of any kind caused by any prize or resulting from awarding, acceptance,
